	<h2> A bit about me</h2>
	<p> Hello, I am Giti. My goal is to become a software Engineer.<br> I'm studying in Computer Science & Engineering at Stamford University Bangladesh. I'm currently in my 10th trimester (4rth year) at CSE Department.<br>I studied in Willes Little Flower School & College. From my childhood, I wanted to discover how a computer works and learn about the hardware and software. CPU, RAM, ROM, what the meaning of these are and about the programming languages, codings such as, C, C++, java, javascript, PHP etc which I had no idea. That's why, I choose this subject. So, after passing my college level, I decided to study in CSE. <br> And now when, I've become able to understand these programming languages. It's feeling amazing to me. I want to know more and learn about the core level of programming languages.<br> I can create a simple web page now. I want to increase my talent in Web Developing.<br>
	I've many hobbies like everyone. I like reciting poems, listening music. Rabindranath Tagor is my favourite writer, poet and musician. I like to read story books. It's good to read the books of Humayun Ahmed, Muhammed Zafar Iqubal in my leisure time. His science fiction 'Iron' made me thrilled. I like writer J. K. Rowling's books too. I am a biggest fan of Harry Potter series.</p>
